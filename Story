One stormy day, I landed into an unknown space. It was enormous.

I looked around and saw a big grey old man. He seemed so rocky and most likely was made of stone. Around him was a grasspatch in a circular shape. Could he be my kind's mortal enemy? Those who inhabited Mars. If so, I was 
in great danger, they were the ones who once destroyed my home with their amazing strength. Where am I? Could this be... MARS!! I was in great danger. I had to hide before
they awoke. There was no time to waste, I must hide, now!

Suddenly, a shadow lurked out of the corner. This was bad!!! I tried to run but the person saw me too soon. Before I could speak, she led me to a room. It said 1H. Inside, there 
were roars of laughter. Additionally, two women stood in front of everyone. 

Then, they said," Welcome to Dunman High School! You too have been allocated to 1H. We hope you enjoy your education in Dunman High."

Finally, I returned to my senses. It was orientation day. The women I had met were my teachers, Ms Ng and Mdm Sim. 

They taught the class with passion, and with their best. A BIG THANK YOU to them.

And you too should know who the mortal enemy was...

The story is not over, and it will never be...
